While there are many pharmaceuticals available to treat these conditions, they often come with a number of unwanted side effects. Fortunately, there are also a number of natural treatments that can be effective in reducing anxiety and stress.\n\nOne such treatment is meditation. Meditation has been shown to be an effective way to reduce stress and anxiety. It helps to improve your focus and concentration, and it can also help you learn how to control your thoughts and emotions. There are a number of different types of meditation, so find one that works best for you and stick with it.\n\nAnother great natural treatment for anxiety and stress is exercise. Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. It also helps to improve your self-confidence and alleviate stress. Choose an activity that you enjoy, so you'll be more likely to stick with it.\n\nFinally, another great way to reduce anxiety and stress is through aromatherapy. Certain essential oils have been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and stress. Lavender oil is one such oil that has been shown to be helpful in this regard. Add a few drops of lavender oil to a diffuser or put a few drops on your wrists or neck when you feel stressed out.\n\n#  What are the benefits of reducing anxiety and stress with natural treatments?\n\nAnxiety and stress can be debilitating, but they can also be reduced with natural treatments.

You will have more energy and be able to think more clearly. You will also be less likely to get sick.\n\nIf you are looking for a way to reduce your anxiety and stress, try using natural treatments. There are many options available, so find the one that works best for you.\n\n#  Are there any side effects to reducing anxiety and stress naturally?\n\nWhen it comes to reducing anxiety and stress naturally, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First, always consult with a doctor before making any changes to your medication or treatment plan. Second, be patient – it may take some time for the natural methods to start working. And third, always be on the lookout for potential side effects.\n\nWhile there are no surefire guarantees when it comes to reducing anxiety and stress naturally, many people have found success in doing so. Some of the most common methods include:\n\n* Practicing yoga or meditation\n\n* Getting enough sleep\n\n* Eating a healthy diet\n\n* Exercising regularly\n\n* Taking herbs or supplements\n\nEach person’s body is different, so you may need to try a few different methods before finding what works best for you. But overall, reducing anxiety and stress naturally is usually safe and has few – if any – side effects.\n\n#  How long will the results of reducing anxiety and stress with natural treatments last?\n\nThe long-term results of reducing anxiety and stress with natural treatments are usually very positive. People generally feel better and have more energy. However, it is important to keep in mind that everyone is different and some people may need to continue using natural treatments to maintain their improved state of mind.\n\nThere are a number of different ways that people can reduce anxiety and stress with natural treatments. Some popular methods include using essential oils, practicing meditation or mindfulness, and eating a healthy diet. All of these methods have been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and stress.\n\nIt is important to find the method or methods that work best for you and to stick with them.

It may take time for the benefits of natural treatments to show themselves.\n\nReducing anxiety and stress can have a significant impact on your overall health and well-being. It can help improve your mood, increase your energy level, and make you feel happier overall.

There are many different types of herbal tea available depending on your needs. Some common herbal teas include chamomile tea for relaxation, ginger tea for digestive support, and echinacea tea for boosting the immune system .\n\n9) Castor oil packs: Castor oil packs are an old folk remedy that are becoming more popular again today . Castor oil packs help to improve circulation, promote healing, reduce inflammation ,and detoxify the body . They can be used on their own or in conjunction with other complementary therapies such as acupuncture\n\n#  What does science have to say about them?\n\n#\n\nThere is a lot of debate surrounding the existence of ghosts, but what does science have to say about them? The short answer is that there is no empirical evidence to support the existence of ghosts and therefore they remain unproven. There are many reasons why scientists don't believe in ghosts, including the fact that there is no scientific evidence to support their existence and that they appear to violate the laws of physics.\n\nOne of the main problems with trying to study ghosts is that there is no agreed-upon definition of what a ghost actually is. This makes it difficult to conduct any sort of scientific study, as you would need to define all of the parameters involved in order to ensure that you are studying what you intend to study. In addition, many purported sightings of ghosts can be easily explained away as natural phenomena or illusions. For example, if you see a shadow on the wall it doesn't automatically mean that there is a ghost present. It's much more likely that the shadow is being cast by something in the room, such as a chair or a lamp.\n\nOne of the other problems with trying to study ghosts is that they allegedly defy the laws of physics. For example, ghosts are said to be able to move through walls and other solid objects, which is something that should not be possible according to our current understanding of physics. If ghosts were real then it would suggest that we don't fully understand the laws of physics, which would be a significant discovery. However, until there is some concrete evidence to support this claim, it remains nothing more than speculation.\n\nSo far, there has been no evidence found that suggests that ghosts exist. All claimed sightings and experiences can be easily explained without invoking supernatural explanations. This doesn't mean that people haven't seen or experienced things that they can't explain, but it does suggest that there is probably a more rational explanation for these events than ghosts. Until science can provide us with some concrete evidence for the existence of ghosts, they will remain nothing more than a myth and speculation.\n\n#  How effective are they?\n\nSince their introduction in the early 1990s, managed care plans have been a source of debate for their effects on the quality and cost of healthcare. Proponents tout the benefits of capitation and utilization review in restraining healthcare spending, while opponents argue that these measures restrict patients’ access to care. A comprehensive study by the RAND Corporation in 2003 attempted to answer this question by comparing healthcare utilization and spending in traditional indemnity plans to HMOs and PPOs.\n\nThe study found that overall, HMOs and PPOs had lower total healthcare spending than traditional indemnity plans. This was largely due to reductions in outpatient services, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions. However, when looking at specific services, HMOs tended to have lower spending for prescription drugs and preventive care, while PPOs had lower spending for specialty care. There was no clear consensus on which type of plan resulted in better quality of care.\n\nSince then, there have been other studies investigating the effectiveness of managed care plans, but the results have been mixed. A study by The Commonwealth Fund in 2006 found that HMOs improved quality more than other types of plans, while a study by the National Institute for Health Care Management in 2007 found that there was no significant difference in quality between HMOs and other types of plans.\n\nDespite these mixed results, the general consensus is that managed care plans can be effective in reducing healthcare spending without sacrificing quality. However, it is important to note that each plan is different and may not be suitable for everyone. Patients should do their research to find the plan that best suits their needs.\n\n#  What are the risks associated with them?\n\n##\n\n\nThere are a number of risks associated with artificial intelligence, from the potential for job losses to concerns about how the technology might be used maliciously.\n\n One of the biggest concerns is that artificial intelligence could be used to automate certain jobs, leading to mass unemployment. For example, if artificial intelligence can be used to efficiently process data or carry out certain tasks, then it could replace human workers in a number of industries. This could lead to large numbers of people being out of work, with potentially devastating consequences for those affected.\n\nAnother issue is that while artificial intelligence can be used to carry out tasks more efficiently than humans can, it may not always be able to make rational decisions. For example, if an artificial intelligence system is given a task and a set of parameters within which to work, it may not be able to account for changes in those parameters. This could lead to unforeseen problems, such as disastrous results from decisions made by artificial intelligence systems that are running autonomously.\n\nA further concern is that artificial intelligence could be used maliciously by individuals or groups with harmful intentions. For example, if artificial intelligence were used to create fake news or interfere with elections, this could have serious implications for society as a whole. Alternatively, if artificial intelligence were used to create powerful weapons systems, this could pose a major risk to global security.\n\nOverall, there are a number of risks associated with artificial intelligence that need to be considered. It is important that we understand these risks and take steps to mitigate them where possible.\n\n#  Are there any side effects?\n\nWhen it comes to prescription medications, it is always important to be aware of the potential side effects before taking them. With antidepressants, there are a few known side effects that can occur in some people.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effect of antidepressants is nausea. This can often be alleviated by taking the medication with food. Other common side effects include headaches, insomnia, and weight gain.\n\nIn rare cases, antidepressants can cause more serious side effects such as suicidal thoughts or behavior. If you experience any unusual changes in mood or behavior while taking an antidepressant, be sure to consult your doctor right away.\n\nOverall, the benefits of antidepressants typically outweigh the risks, but it’s always important to be aware of what to look for if you experience any side effects.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-9-home-remedies.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the 9 home remedies\ndate: 2022-09-20 18:10:02\ncategories:\n- Natural treatment\ntags:\n- Natural Medicine\n- Natural Remedies\n- Natural Remedy}Home Remedies\n---\n\n\n#  What are the 9 home remedies?\n\nThere are many home remedies for various health conditions.

The short answer is that there is no empirical evidence to support the existence of ghosts and therefore they remain unproven. There are many reasons why scientists don’t believe in ghosts, including the fact that there is no scientific evidence to support their existence and that they appear to violate the laws of physics.</p>\n<p>One of the main problems with trying to study ghosts is that there is no agreed-upon definition of what a ghost actually is. This makes it difficult to conduct any sort of scientific study, as you would need to define all of the parameters involved in order to ensure that you are studying what you intend to study. In addition, many purported sightings of ghosts can be easily explained away as natural phenomena or illusions. For example, if you see a shadow on the wall it doesn’t automatically mean that there is a ghost present. It’s much more likely that the shadow is being cast by something in the room, such as a chair or a lamp.</p>\n<p>One of the other problems with trying to study ghosts is that they allegedly defy the laws of physics. For example, ghosts are said to be able to move through walls and other solid objects, which is something that should not be possible according to our current understanding of physics. If ghosts were real then it would suggest that we don’t fully understand the laws of physics, which would be a significant discovery. However, until there is some concrete evidence to support this claim, it remains nothing more than speculation.</p>\n<p>So far, there has been no evidence found that suggests that ghosts exist. All claimed sightings and experiences can be easily explained without invoking supernatural explanations. This doesn’t mean that people haven’t seen or experienced things that they can’t explain, but it does suggest that there is probably a more rational explanation for these events than ghosts. Until science can provide us with some concrete evidence for the existence of ghosts, they will remain nothing more than a myth and speculation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-effective-are-they\"><a href=\"#How-effective-are-they\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How effective are they?\"></a>How effective are they?</h1><p>Since their introduction in the early 1990s, managed care plans have been a source of debate for their effects on the quality and cost of healthcare. Proponents tout the benefits of capitation and utilization review in restraining healthcare spending, while opponents argue that these measures restrict patients’ access to care. A comprehensive study by the RAND Corporation in 2003 attempted to answer this question by comparing healthcare utilization and spending in traditional indemnity plans to HMOs and PPOs.</p>\n<p>The study found that overall, HMOs and PPOs had lower total healthcare spending than traditional indemnity plans. This was largely due to reductions in outpatient services, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions. However, when looking at specific services, HMOs tended to have lower spending for prescription drugs and preventive care, while PPOs had lower spending for specialty care. There was no clear consensus on which type of plan resulted in better quality of care.</p>\n<p>Since then, there have been other studies investigating the effectiveness of managed care plans, but the results have been mixed. A study by The Commonwealth Fund in 2006 found that HMOs improved quality more than other types of plans, while a study by the National Institute for Health Care Management in 2007 found that there was no significant difference in quality between HMOs and other types of plans.</p>\n<p>Despite these mixed results, the general consensus is that managed care plans can be effective in reducing healthcare spending without sacrificing quality. However, it is important to note that each plan is different and may not be suitable for everyone. Patients should do their research to find the plan that best suits their needs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-are-the-risks-associated-with-them\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-risks-associated-with-them\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the risks associated with them?\"></a>What are the risks associated with them?</h1><h2 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h2><p>There are a number of risks associated with artificial intelligence, from the potential for job losses to concerns about how the technology might be used maliciously.</p>\n<p> One of the biggest concerns is that artificial intelligence could be used to automate certain jobs, leading to mass unemployment. For example, if artificial intelligence can be used to efficiently process data or carry out certain tasks, then it could replace human workers in a number of industries. This could lead to large numbers of people being out of work, with potentially devastating consequences for those affected.</p>\n<p>Another issue is that while artificial intelligence can be used to carry out tasks more efficiently than humans can, it may not always be able to make rational decisions. For example, if an artificial intelligence system is given a task and a set of parameters within which to work, it may not be able to account for changes in those parameters. This could lead to unforeseen problems, such as disastrous results from decisions made by artificial intelligence systems that are running autonomously.</p>\n<p>A further concern is that artificial intelligence could be used maliciously by individuals or groups with harmful intentions. For example, if artificial intelligence were used to create fake news or interfere with elections, this could have serious implications for society as a whole. Alternatively, if artificial intelligence were used to create powerful weapons systems, this could pose a major risk to global security.</p>\n<p>Overall, there are a number of risks associated with artificial intelligence that need to be considered.

He played 8 seasons for the Magic, making 6 all-star teams and being named the defensive player of the year 3 times. He led the Magic to the NBA Finals in 2009, where they were defeated by the Lakers. After 2011, Howard requested a trade to another team and was eventually traded to the Lakers.\n\nIs it fair to say that without Dwight Howard, the Orlando Magic would not have been as successful as they were? Let's take a look at their record with and without him.\n\nWith Dwight Howard: 292-187 (.614)\n\nWithout Dwight Howard: 116-216 (.348)\n\n#  Would he perform better on a different team?\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation concerning the future of superstar quarterback, <Player Name>. The most recent talk is that he may be traded to another team before the start of the next season. Fans and analysts have been trying to figure out where he would be the best fit.\n\nOne potential destination for <Player Name> is the <Team Name> organization. This team has a strong defense and a talented running back in <Player Name>. Adding <Player Name> would make them a serious playoff contender.\n\nAnother possible landing spot for <Player Name> is the <Team Name> organization. This team has a young, up-and-coming offense that could really use a player like him. They are also in need of a good quarterback after trading away their former starter, <Player Name>.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where <Player Name> ends up and how he performs on his new team. One thing is for sure – whichever team he plays for will be better off for it.\n\n#  Is Platon a good coach for the Magic?\n\n\n\nPlatonism, named after the philosopher Plato, is the view that physical objects and physical events are only imperfect copies of perfect Forms or Ideas. In other words, physical objects are like shadows of ideal objects.\n\nPlato (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) was a Classical Greek philosopher, mathematician, student of Socrates, writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens – the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.\n\nPlato's philosophy has been summed up in two famous sayings: \"The world is a cave,\" and \"There is no such thing as platonic love.\"\n\nThe first saying refers to Plato's belief that physical objects are only imperfect shadows of perfect Forms or Ideas. The second saying refers to Plato's belief that physical love is an inferior imitation of a pure and perfect form of love which exists only in the mind.\n\nI think Platon would be a great coach for the Magic because he believes in things that are intangible. He bases his decisions on theory and not what everyone else thinks. This would be great for a young team like Orlando because they need someone who can mold them into a winning team mentally.\n\n#  Will the Magic front office make any changes this offseason?\n\nThe Magic front office will likely make changes this offseason, though the specific moves they make are yet to be seen. The team has failed to reach the playoffs for the past six seasons, and it's clear that something needs to change.\n\nThere are a few questions that the team will need to answer in the coming months. First, who will be their head coach next season? Frank Vogel was fired after the team's first-round playoff exit. Second, who will be their starting point guard next season? Elfrid Payton is a free agent and is unlikely to re-sign with Orlando. Third, what players should they target in free agency? Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic are both free agents, and it's unclear whether the Magic will re-sign them.\n\nIf I were a betting man, I would say that the Magic will hire Steve Clifford as their next head coach. He coached Dwight Howard when he was with the Lakers, so he has experience working with big men. As for their starting point guard, I think they'll target Eric Bledsoe in free agency. He's a young player who is already an All-Star caliber player. And finally, I think they'll try to re-sign Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic. They're both young players who have shown potential and could continue to develop under new head coach Steve Clifford.\n\n#  Who will be the starting point guard for the Magic next season?\n\nThe Orlando Magic have a few decisions to make this offseason, but the question of who will be the starting point guard is one of the most intriguing. Elfrid Payton had a breakout year in 2016-2017, but he is a restricted free agent and may not be affordable for the Magic. D.J. Augustin played well as a backup last season and could take over as the starter. There are also several other players who could compete for the starting job, including Shelvin Mack and Mario Hezonja.\n\nPayton had an up-and-down season last year, but he showed improvement as the year went on. In February and March, he averaged 15 points and 9 assists per game while shooting 47% from the field. He also proved himself as a capable defender, averaging 1.8 steals per game. If Payton can continue to improve his shooting and playmaking skills, he could be a valuable player for the Magic next season.\n\nHowever, if the Magic want to keep Payton, they may have to pay a high price tag in free agency. According to ESPN's Zach Lowe, Payton may command a contract worth around $18 million per year. The Magic may not be willing to pay that much for a player who has yet to prove himself as a consistent starter.\n\nIf Payton doesn't re-sign with the Magic, D.J. Augustin could become the starting point guard. Augustin was acquired by the Magic at the trade deadline last season and averaged 11 points and 4 assists in 23 games with Orlando. He also has experience as a starter, having been the primary point guard for both Indiana and Denver in previous seasons.\n\nThere are also several other players who could compete for the starting job in training camp, including Shelvin Mack and Mario Hezonja. Mack was acquired by the Magic in a trade with Utah last offseason and played well as a backup point guard last season. He averaged 7 points and 3 assists in 17 minutes per game while shooting 43% from three-point range.\n\nHezonja was drafted fifth overall by Orlando in 2015 but failed to live up to expectations his first two seasons. However, he showed signs of improvement late last season and averaged 10 points per game in April while shooting 50% from three-point range. If he can continue to develop his offensive skills, he could compete for minutes at point guard next season.","source":"_posts/Would-Sbotop-still-be-in-the-Orlando-Magic-if-they-never-drafted-him.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Would Sbotop still be in the Orlando Magic if they never drafted him\ndate: 2022-09-22 20:10:34\ncategories:\n- Sbotop\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Would Sbotop still be in the Orlando Magic if they never drafted him?\n\nDwight Howard was drafted first overall in 2004 by the Orlando Magic.

He played 8 seasons for the Magic, making 6 all-star teams and being named the defensive player of the year 3 times. He led the Magic to the NBA Finals in 2009, where they were defeated by the Lakers. After 2011, Howard requested a trade to another team and was eventually traded to the Lakers.</p>\n<p>Is it fair to say that without Dwight Howard, the Orlando Magic would not have been as successful as they were? Let’s take a look at their record with and without him.</p>\n<p>With Dwight Howard: 292-187 (.614)</p>\n<p>Without Dwight Howard: 116-216 (.348)</p>\n<h1 id=\"Would-he-perform-better-on-a-different-team\"><a href=\"#Would-he-perform-better-on-a-different-team\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Would he perform better on a different team?\"></a>Would he perform better on a different team?</h1><p>There has been a lot of speculation concerning the future of superstar quarterback, <Player Name>. The most recent talk is that he may be traded to another team before the start of the next season. Fans and analysts have been trying to figure out where he would be the best fit.</p>\n<p>One potential destination for <Player Name> is the <Team Name> organization. This team has a strong defense and a talented running back in <Player Name>. Adding <Player Name> would make them a serious playoff contender.</p>\n<p>Another possible landing spot for <Player Name> is the <Team Name> organization. This team has a young, up-and-coming offense that could really use a player like him. They are also in need of a good quarterback after trading away their former starter, <Player Name>.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see where <Player Name> ends up and how he performs on his new team. One thing is for sure – whichever team he plays for will be better off for it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Is-Platon-a-good-coach-for-the-Magic\"><a href=\"#Is-Platon-a-good-coach-for-the-Magic\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Is Platon a good coach for the Magic?\"></a>Is Platon a good coach for the Magic?</h1><p>Platonism, named after the philosopher Plato, is the view that physical objects and physical events are only imperfect copies of perfect Forms or Ideas. In other words, physical objects are like shadows of ideal objects.</p>\n<p>Plato (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) was a Classical Greek philosopher, mathematician, student of Socrates, writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens – the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.</p>\n<p>Plato’s philosophy has been summed up in two famous sayings: “The world is a cave,” and “There is no such thing as platonic love.”</p>\n<p>The first saying refers to Plato’s belief that physical objects are only imperfect shadows of perfect Forms or Ideas. The second saying refers to Plato’s belief that physical love is an inferior imitation of a pure and perfect form of love which exists only in the mind.</p>\n<p>I think Platon would be a great coach for the Magic because he believes in things that are intangible. He bases his decisions on theory and not what everyone else thinks. This would be great for a young team like Orlando because they need someone who can mold them into a winning team mentally.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Will-the-Magic-front-office-make-any-changes-this-offseason\"><a href=\"#Will-the-Magic-front-office-make-any-changes-this-offseason\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Will the Magic front office make any changes this offseason?\"></a>Will the Magic front office make any changes this offseason?</h1><p>The Magic front office will likely make changes this offseason, though the specific moves they make are yet to be seen. The team has failed to reach the playoffs for the past six seasons, and it’s clear that something needs to change.</p>\n<p>There are a few questions that the team will need to answer in the coming months. First, who will be their head coach next season? Frank Vogel was fired after the team’s first-round playoff exit. Second, who will be their starting point guard next season? Elfrid Payton is a free agent and is unlikely to re-sign with Orlando. Third, what players should they target in free agency? Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic are both free agents, and it’s unclear whether the Magic will re-sign them.</p>\n<p>If I were a betting man, I would say that the Magic will hire Steve Clifford as their next head coach. He coached Dwight Howard when he was with the Lakers, so he has experience working with big men. As for their starting point guard, I think they’ll target Eric Bledsoe in free agency. He’s a young player who is already an All-Star caliber player. And finally, I think they’ll try to re-sign Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic. They’re both young players who have shown potential and could continue to develop under new head coach Steve Clifford.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Who-will-be-the-starting-point-guard-for-the-Magic-next-season\"><a href=\"#Who-will-be-the-starting-point-guard-for-the-Magic-next-season\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Who will be the starting point guard for the Magic next season?\"></a>Who will be the starting point guard for the Magic next season?</h1><p>The Orlando Magic have a few decisions to make this offseason, but the question of who will be the starting point guard is one of the most intriguing. Elfrid Payton had a breakout year in 2016-2017, but he is a restricted free agent and may not be affordable for the Magic. D.J. Augustin played well as a backup last season and could take over as the starter. There are also several other players who could compete for the starting job, including Shelvin Mack and Mario Hezonja.</p>\n<p>Payton had an up-and-down season last year, but he showed improvement as the year went on. In February and March, he averaged 15 points and 9 assists per game while shooting 47% from the field. He also proved himself as a capable defender, averaging 1.8 steals per game. If Payton can continue to improve his shooting and playmaking skills, he could be a valuable player for the Magic next season.</p>\n<p>However, if the Magic want to keep Payton, they may have to pay a high price tag in free agency. According to ESPN’s Zach Lowe, Payton may command a contract worth around $18 million per year. The Magic may not be willing to pay that much for a player who has yet to prove himself as a consistent starter.</p>\n<p>If Payton doesn’t re-sign with the Magic, D.J. Augustin could become the starting point guard. Augustin was acquired by the Magic at the trade deadline last season and averaged 11 points and 4 assists in 23 games with Orlando. He also has experience as a starter, having been the primary point guard for both Indiana and Denver in previous seasons.</p>\n<p>There are also several other players who could compete for the starting job in training camp, including Shelvin Mack and Mario Hezonja. Mack was acquired by the Magic in a trade with Utah last offseason and played well as a backup point guard last season. He averaged 7 points and 3 assists in 17 minutes per game while shooting 43% from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Hezonja was drafted fifth overall by Orlando in 2015 but failed to live up to expectations his first two seasons. However, he showed signs of improvement late last season and averaged 10 points per game in April while shooting 50% from three-point range. If he can continue to develop his offensive skills, he could compete for minutes at point guard next season.</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[{"post_id":"cl6w2ajth0002t0v55boyg3x8","category_id":"cl6w2ajtl0003t0v568dh18fj","_id":"cl6w2ajto0006t0v57wdt6etk"},{"post_id":"cl8a1bzep0000iov597yg26ji","category_id":"cl6w2ajtl0003t0v568dh18fj","_id":"cl8a1bzf00002iov587x8607d"},{"post_id":"cl8d0iotp0000o0v542lo285n","category_id":"cl8d0iou00001o0v55wux3a0u","_id":"cl8d0iou20002o0v54hzwer8k"}],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cl6w2ajth0002t0v55boyg3x8","tag_id":"cl6w2ajtm0004t0v5355mb97j","_id":"cl6w2ajtp0008t0v54se36kj7"},{"post_id":"cl6w2ajth0002t0v55boyg3x8","tag_id":"cl6w2ajtn0005t0v5cef5di1x","_id":"cl6w2ajtp0009t0v54fk0ahd4"},{"post_id":"cl6w2ajth0002t0v55boyg3x8","tag_id":"cl6w2ajto0007t0v5eegu9fyf","_id":"cl6w2ajtp000at0v5al145tnv"},{"post_id":"cl8a1bzep0000iov597yg26ji","tag_id":"cl8a1bzew0001iov5288pdbxg","_id":"cl8a1bzf90005iov503glcbg3"},{"post_id":"cl8a1bzep0000iov597yg26ji","tag_id":"cl8a1bzf10003iov501cl41kq","_id":"cl8a1bzfa0006iov568a5httb"},{"post_id":"cl8a1bzep0000iov597yg26ji","tag_id":"cl8a1bzf30004iov5hrl957ui","_id":"cl8a1bzfa0007iov51mqd3l73"}],"Tag":[{"name":"natural medicine","_id":"cl6w2ajtm0004t0v5355mb97j"},{"name":"natural remedies","_id":"cl6w2ajtn0005t0v5cef5di1x"},{"name":"natural remedy}home remedies","_id":"cl6w2ajto0007t0v5eegu9fyf"},{"name":"Natural Medicine","_id":"cl8a1bzew0001iov5288pdbxg"},{"name":"Natural Remedies","_id":"cl8a1bzf10003iov501cl41kq"},{"name":"Natural Remedy}Home Remedies","_id":"cl8a1bzf30004iov5hrl957ui"}]}}
