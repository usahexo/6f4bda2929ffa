            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Would-Sbotop-still-be-in-the-Orlando-Magic-if-they-never-drafted-him"><a href="#Would-Sbotop-still-be-in-the-Orlando-Magic-if-they-never-drafted-him" class="headerlink" title="Would Sbotop still be in the Orlando Magic if they never drafted him?"></a>Would Sbotop still be in the Orlando Magic if they never drafted him?</h1><p>Dwight Howard was drafted first overall in 2004 by the Orlando Magic. He played 8 seasons for the Magic, making 6 all-star teams and being named the defensive player of the year 3 times. He led the Magic to the NBA Finals in 2009, where they were defeated by the Lakers. After 2011, Howard requested a trade to another team and was eventually traded to the Lakers.</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that without Dwight Howard, the Orlando Magic would not have been as successful as they were? Let’s take a look at their record with and without him.</p>
<p>With Dwight Howard: 292-187 (.614)</p>
<p>Without Dwight Howard: 116-216 (.348)</p>
<h1 id="Would-he-perform-better-on-a-different-team"><a href="#Would-he-perform-better-on-a-different-team" class="headerlink" title="Would he perform better on a different team?"></a>Would he perform better on a different team?</h1><p>There has been a lot of speculation concerning the future of superstar quarterback, <Player Name>. The most recent talk is that he may be traded to another team before the start of the next season. Fans and analysts have been trying to figure out where he would be the best fit.</p>
<p>One potential destination for <Player Name> is the <Team Name> organization. This team has a strong defense and a talented running back in <Player Name>. Adding <Player Name> would make them a serious playoff contender.</p>
<p>Another possible landing spot for <Player Name> is the <Team Name> organization. This team has a young, up-and-coming offense that could really use a player like him. They are also in need of a good quarterback after trading away their former starter, <Player Name>.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see where <Player Name> ends up and how he performs on his new team. One thing is for sure – whichever team he plays for will be better off for it.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Platon-a-good-coach-for-the-Magic"><a href="#Is-Platon-a-good-coach-for-the-Magic" class="headerlink" title="Is Platon a good coach for the Magic?"></a>Is Platon a good coach for the Magic?</h1><p>Platonism, named after the philosopher Plato, is the view that physical objects and physical events are only imperfect copies of perfect Forms or Ideas. In other words, physical objects are like shadows of ideal objects.</p>
<p>Plato (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) was a Classical Greek philosopher, mathematician, student of Socrates, writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens – the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.</p>
<p>Plato’s philosophy has been summed up in two famous sayings: “The world is a cave,” and “There is no such thing as platonic love.”</p>
<p>The first saying refers to Plato’s belief that physical objects are only imperfect shadows of perfect Forms or Ideas. The second saying refers to Plato’s belief that physical love is an inferior imitation of a pure and perfect form of love which exists only in the mind.</p>
<p>I think Platon would be a great coach for the Magic because he believes in things that are intangible. He bases his decisions on theory and not what everyone else thinks. This would be great for a young team like Orlando because they need someone who can mold them into a winning team mentally.</p>
<h1 id="Will-the-Magic-front-office-make-any-changes-this-offseason"><a href="#Will-the-Magic-front-office-make-any-changes-this-offseason" class="headerlink" title="Will the Magic front office make any changes this offseason?"></a>Will the Magic front office make any changes this offseason?</h1><p>The Magic front office will likely make changes this offseason, though the specific moves they make are yet to be seen. The team has failed to reach the playoffs for the past six seasons, and it’s clear that something needs to change.</p>
<p>There are a few questions that the team will need to answer in the coming months. First, who will be their head coach next season? Frank Vogel was fired after the team’s first-round playoff exit. Second, who will be their starting point guard next season? Elfrid Payton is a free agent and is unlikely to re-sign with Orlando. Third, what players should they target in free agency? Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic are both free agents, and it’s unclear whether the Magic will re-sign them.</p>
<p>If I were a betting man, I would say that the Magic will hire Steve Clifford as their next head coach. He coached Dwight Howard when he was with the Lakers, so he has experience working with big men. As for their starting point guard, I think they’ll target Eric Bledsoe in free agency. He’s a young player who is already an All-Star caliber player. And finally, I think they’ll try to re-sign Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic. They’re both young players who have shown potential and could continue to develop under new head coach Steve Clifford.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-be-the-starting-point-guard-for-the-Magic-next-season"><a href="#Who-will-be-the-starting-point-guard-for-the-Magic-next-season" class="headerlink" title="Who will be the starting point guard for the Magic next season?"></a>Who will be the starting point guard for the Magic next season?</h1><p>The Orlando Magic have a few decisions to make this offseason, but the question of who will be the starting point guard is one of the most intriguing. Elfrid Payton had a breakout year in 2016-2017, but he is a restricted free agent and may not be affordable for the Magic. D.J. Augustin played well as a backup last season and could take over as the starter. There are also several other players who could compete for the starting job, including Shelvin Mack and Mario Hezonja.</p>
<p>Payton had an up-and-down season last year, but he showed improvement as the year went on. In February and March, he averaged 15 points and 9 assists per game while shooting 47% from the field. He also proved himself as a capable defender, averaging 1.8 steals per game. If Payton can continue to improve his shooting and playmaking skills, he could be a valuable player for the Magic next season.</p>
<p>However, if the Magic want to keep Payton, they may have to pay a high price tag in free agency. According to ESPN’s Zach Lowe, Payton may command a contract worth around $18 million per year. The Magic may not be willing to pay that much for a player who has yet to prove himself as a consistent starter.</p>
<p>If Payton doesn’t re-sign with the Magic, D.J. Augustin could become the starting point guard. Augustin was acquired by the Magic at the trade deadline last season and averaged 11 points and 4 assists in 23 games with Orlando. He also has experience as a starter, having been the primary point guard for both Indiana and Denver in previous seasons.</p>
<p>There are also several other players who could compete for the starting job in training camp, including Shelvin Mack and Mario Hezonja. Mack was acquired by the Magic in a trade with Utah last offseason and played well as a backup point guard last season. He averaged 7 points and 3 assists in 17 minutes per game while shooting 43% from three-point range.</p>
<p>Hezonja was drafted fifth overall by Orlando in 2015 but failed to live up to expectations his first two seasons. However, he showed signs of improvement late last season and averaged 10 points per game in April while shooting 50% from three-point range. If he can continue to develop his offensive skills, he could compete for minutes at point guard next season.</p>
