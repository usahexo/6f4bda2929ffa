<h1 id="Poker-Hands-Ranking-Learn-the-Basics-of-Poker"><a href="#Poker-Hands-Ranking-Learn-the-Basics-of-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Poker Hands Ranking: Learn the Basics of Poker"></a>Poker Hands Ranking: Learn the Basics of Poker</h1><p>Knowing the ranking of poker hands is essential for playing the game. This guide will teach you the basics of poker hands and what beats what.</p>
<p>The ranking of poker hands is as follows, from highest to lowest:</p>
<p>Straight flush<br>Four of a kind<br>Full house<br>Flush<br>Straight<br>Three of a kind<br>Two pair<br>One pair<br>High card</p>
<p>A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. The highest card in the straight flush determines the rank of the hand. If two players have a straight flush, then the rank is determined by the highest card in the hand. For example, if one player has an Ace-King-Queen-Jack-Ten and the other player has an Ace-Two-Three-Four-Five, then the first player would win because their highest card (the Ace) is higher than the second player’s highest card (the Two).</p>
<p>A four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank and another random card. The rank of the four of a kind determines the rank of the hand. If two players have four of a kind, then it is a tie. For example, if one player has two sets of four Kings and another player has two sets of four Aces, then both players would have a hand rank of Four Of A Kind. If both players had two different sets of fours, then the higher ranked set would win (for example, if one player had 4 Jacks and 3 Kings while another player had 4 Queens and 2 Tens, then the first player would win).</p>
<p>A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. The rank of the full house determines the rank of the hand. If two players have a full house, then it is a tie. For example, if one player has three 6’s and two 2’s while another player has three 3’s and two 9’s, then both players would have a hand rank Full House. If both players had different full houses (for example, one had three 7’s and two 5’s while other had three Aces and two 2’s), then ties would be broken by comparing pairs - so in this scenario, player with 7’s and 5’s would win.         </p>
<p>A flush is made up five cards all with the same suit but not in sequential order.. The rank determination for flushes are exactly like straights; but using only suits instead values numerically ace high low to 2 low). So 3 ♥ 4 ♦ 5 ♣ 6 ♠ &gt; 2 ♠ 3 ♣ 4 ♥ 5♦ (remember clubs are low). If both flushes contain AKQJT their suits are compared to determine who wins (eighth street comes into play should there be more than one flush on board)</p>
<p> A regular straight (ie 5♦ 6♣ 7♥ 8♠) trumps an Ace high straight (4♥ 5♦ 6♣ 7♥ 8♣) or any other type Straight ie: 2♥ 3♦ 4♣ 5♥ 6♦)</p>
<p> Three cards matching (such as 222) always beats two pair (AKQJ). So does any Pair overpairing AKQJ i.e 111 &gt; JKQ2</p>
<p> Winner is decided with High Card where each individual playing holds just one High Card; so for instance K♥ 9♦ 4♠ 3♣ &gt; A♥ 8♥ 6♦ 2♣</p>
