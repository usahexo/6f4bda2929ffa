#  Arcadia Game launches new Ladbrokes Casino reward program

Arcadia Game, the online casino operator, has announced the launch of a new Ladbrokes Casino reward program. The program, which will be available to both new and existing players, offers a range of benefits that include bonuses, cashback, and entry into prize draws.

The new program offers players the chance to earn rewards based on their loyalty levels. Players can move up through four loyalty tiers – Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum – by earning points for every £10 they wager. The higher the tier, the more benefits players can enjoy.

Benefits at each tier include:

*Bronze: 10% bonus on first deposit and entry into prize draw worth £500

*Silver: 20% bonus on first deposit, 5% cashback on net losses each week, and entry into prize draw worth £1,000

*Gold: 30% bonus on first deposit, 7.5% cashback on net losses each week, and entry into prize draw worth £2,000

*Platinum: 40% bonus on first deposit, 10% cashback on net losses each week, and entry into prize draw worth £3,000

In addition to the above benefits, players in the Gold and Platinum tiers also receive invitations to exclusive VIP events. These events offer players the chance to enjoy luxury prizes such as holidays and exclusive gaming experiences.

Commenting on the launch of the new reward program, Arcadia Game’s CEO James Ford said: “We are really excited to be launching our new reward program which offers fantastic benefits to both new and existing players. We know that our customers value great rewards so we have worked hard to create a program that offers something for everyone. We can’t wait for our players to start enjoying all that it has to offer!”
