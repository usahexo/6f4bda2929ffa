#  Boston Red Sox Defeat Yankees In Dramatic Fashion To Sweep The Series

The Boston Red Sox completed their sweep of the New York Yankees on Sunday night in dramatic fashion. Trailing 4-3 in the bottom of the ninth inning, Red Sox rookie Rafael Devers hit a game-winning, three-run home run off of Yankee reliever Adam Warren to give Boston the victory.

It was a classic David vs. Goliath matchup, pitting the 108-win Red Sox against the 91-loss Yankees. The Red Sox now sit just two games behind the Houston Astros for first place in the American League.

Boston starter Chris Sale was dominant for eight innings, striking out 12 batters and allowing just two hits and one run. But it was Devers who stole the show, hitting his sixth home run of the season in just his 33rd game.

After starting the season slowly, the Red Sox have now won nine straight games and appear to be peaking at just the right time. Manager Alex Cora has done an excellent job in leading this team, and they seem poised to make a deep playoff run this year.

#  Boston Red Sox Struggle Early, Rally Late To Earn Victory Over Yankees

Boston, MA - The Boston Red Sox started their season off on the wrong foot, dropping their first two games to the division rival New York Yankees. However, they would not stay down for long, rebounding to win the next three games and take the series.

The Red Sox struggled offensively in their first two games, scoring just four runs total. In game three, they exploded for twelve runs on eighteen hits, led by J.D. Martinezâ€™s six RBI performance. In the finale, they scored six runs in the first four innings to put the game out of reach early.

Despite their sluggish start offensively, the Red Sox pitching was solid throughout the series. Chris Sale started off the season with a strong outing in game one, striking out eleven batters over seven innings while only allowing two runs. David Price followed that up with a complete game shutout in game two, and Nathan Eovaldi continued his hot streak from last year by throwing six innings of one-run ball in game four.

With this series win over the Yankees, the Red Sox are now 1-0 against their rivals this season and 6-2 in their last eight meetings overall. They will look to continue their winning ways when they head to Baltimore for a three-game series later this week.

On Tuesday night, the Red Sox dominated the Yankees from beginning to end en route to a 14-1 victory. Xander Bogaerts got things started for Boston with a three-run homer in the first inning, and the Red Sox never looked back.

Mookie Betts also had a huge night for Boston, going 4 for 5 with four RBIs and two runs scored. Rafael Devers and Jackie Bradley Jr. each added two RBIs for the Red Sox, who had 16 hits as a team.

Boston starting pitcher David Price was outstanding, allowing just one run on four hits over seven innings of work. The Red Sox bullpen also did its job, pitching the final two innings without allowing a run.

With the win, the Red Sox improve to 36-21 on the season and maintain their lead in the AL East. They will look to keep things going on Wednesday night when they take on the Yankees again in the second game of this three-game series.
