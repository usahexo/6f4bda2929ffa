#  Twins lose All-Star game – again

For the third consecutive year, the Twins took home another loss in the All-Star game.

The American League squad was led by José Ramírez and his two home runs, while the National League had Max Scherzer as its star pitcher.

Minnesota did have a few contributors, including Eddie Rosario who made a diving catch in the outfield and Jorge Polanco who hit a triple.

The Twins will now look to regain their form as they head into the second half of the season.

#  Twins sign top free agent starting pitcher

The Minnesota Twins announced they have signed top free agent starting pitcher Yu Darvish to a six-year, $126 million contract.

This is a big move for the Twins as they look to contend in the American League Central Division. Darvish is coming off a disappointing season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he is still one of the best pitchers in baseball.

The Twins are hoping that Darvish can turn things around and help them make a run at the World Series. He will join a rotation that already includes Jose Berrios and Ervin Santana.

Darvish had some great seasons with the Texas Rangers before signing with the Dodgers last winter. He went 56-42 with a 3.42 ERA in 125 starts for Texas.

He was even better in Los Angeles, going 10-12 with a 3.86 ERA in 31 starts. However, his performance in the postseason was a major disappointment as he went 0-3 with a 21.60 ERA in three starts.

The Twins are betting that Darvish can put those playoff struggles behind him and help them make a run at their first World Series championship since 1991.

#  Twins win opening day game

The Twins won the opening day game with an 8-3 victory over the Orioles. The Twins got off to a strong start, scoring four runs in the first inning. They added another four runs in the third inning, including a three-run homer by Miguel Sano.

Ervin Santana pitched six innings for the Twins, allowing three runs on six hits. He recorded eight strikeouts and walked one batter. Fernando Rodney came in to pitch the ninth inning and got the save.

The Twins are now 1-0 and will next play on Tuesday against the Blue Jays.

#  Byron Buxton has breakout season with Twins

In 2016, Twins outfielder Byron Buxton had a breakout season, which led to him being named an All-Star. He batted .259 with 16 home runs, 52 RBIs, and 29 stolen bases in 139 games.

Prior to the 2016 season, Buxton had been plagued by injuries and poor performance. In his first two seasons in the majors, he batted just .183 with 22 RBIs and 12 stolen bases in 137 games.

However, Buxton turned things around in 2016 thanks to a revamped swing and improved health. He began hitting the ball with more authority, as evidenced by his .354 slugging percentage, which was significantly higher than his .297 slugging percentage in 2015.

Buxton also benefited from playing in a lineup that featured Miguel Sano and Joe Mauer. With those two hitters batting behind him, he was able to get better pitches to hit, which helped him improve his batting average by over 30 points from 2015 to 2016.

Looking ahead to the 2017 season, Twins fans can expect even more from Buxton. He should continue to bat leadoff for the Twins and could potentially challenge for the American League MVP Award.

#  Twins repeats as division champs

The Twins have won the AL Central Division for the second consecutive year. This is a remarkable achievement, as the Twins are a small-market team that competes against much larger teams in the division.

The Twins clinched the division title on Tuesday night with a 4-2 win over the Tigers. This was an important victory, as it prevented the Tigers from gaining any ground in the playoff race.

The Twins’ pitching has been one of the keys to their success. Ervin Santana has been a standout starter, and Fernando Rodney has been one of the most reliable closers in baseball.

The Twins also have a strong lineup, featuring sluggers Eddie Rosario and Miguel Sano.

The Twins will now try to win their first World Series championship since 1987.
