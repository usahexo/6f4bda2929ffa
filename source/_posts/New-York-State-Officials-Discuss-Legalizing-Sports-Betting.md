#  New York State Officials Discuss Legalizing Sports Betting

On Wednesday, a group of New York state officials gathered to discuss the potential benefits of legalizing sports betting in the state. The group, which included legislators, casino operators and racetrack owners, unanimously agreed that legalizing sports betting would be beneficial for the state's economy.

"Legalized sports betting is coming to New York," said Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, chairman of the Racing and Wagering Committee. "It will create jobs, generate revenue for education and help support our local businesses."

There is strong bipartisan support for legalizing sports betting in New York. Both Democrats and Republicans agree that it would be a lucrative industry for the state, and that it would provide much-needed revenue for important causes like education. In addition to creating jobs and generating tax revenue, proponents also argue that legalized sports betting would reduce illegal gambling activity.

Casino operators are particularly eager to see sports betting legalized in New York. They believe that it would provide a new source of revenue and attract more customers to their casinos. Racetrack owners are also in favor of legalization, as they believe it would give them an edge over competing casinos.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting in New York include religious groups and anti-gambling activists. They argue that it could lead to increased addiction rates and social ills. However, these groups are in the minority, and there is broad support for legalization among the general population.

If Sports Betting Is Legalized In New York What You Need To Know by 

The first thing you need to know if you’re thinking about betting on sports in New York State is that it’s not quite legal yet! There are some things that still need to happen before residents can start placing bets at their favorite sportsbook or online casino but we’re getting closer every day according to recent news reports from Albany. So what do you need to know? Let’s go over some basics:Online vs Brick and Mortar- If you decide you want to bet on sports at one of the tribal casinos or racetracks around the state then you can do so either online or at the physical location. Most places will have both options available to customers with some even offering bonus incentives for signing up or playing online (just make sure your preferred site has a license from NY!).Minimum Bets- The minimum legal bet size will be $2 just like Nevada although this could change once things are finally ironed out so keep an eye out. There doesn’t seem to be much limit on how high wagers can go however with some notable exceptions such as no single bet being allowed over $10,000 on football games!Taxes- This is probably one of the more important details for gamblers to pay attention to as taxes can really cut into potential profits (or losses). NYS plans on charging an 8% tax on all gaming revenues which is pretty standard compared other states but make sure you factor it into your calculations!Sports offered- Once again this could very depending on where you choose place your bets but typically you can expect most major US leagues (NFL, NBA etc.) as well as international events/leagues like soccer or cricket., parlay cards etc.). Basically if there’s a sport out there then somebody in NYS will probably take bets on it!So there you have it, some key points to consider if sports betting is legalized in NYS anytime soon! As always we recommend doing your own research beforehand as laws and regulations surrounding gambling can (and do!) change frequently so stay tuned!.

#  Sports Betting Could Be Legalized In New York By The End Of 2018

After years of discussion and debate, lawmakers in New York appear to be close to legalizing sports betting in the state. According to a report from CBS News on Wednesday, both the Assembly and Senate in New York are expected to vote on a bill that would legalize sports betting before the end of the year.

If the bill is approved, it would mark a major victory for the gaming industry, which has been pushing for legalization of sports betting in the United States for years. The move would also likely be welcomed by casino operators in New York, such as MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR), who could see an increase in foot traffic and revenue if sports betting is legalized.

It’s worth noting that while lawmakers in New York appear to be close to approving a bill to legalize sports betting, it’s still not clear if Governor Andrew Cuomo will sign it into law. Cuomo has previously expressed reservations about legalizing sports betting, but he has not said whether he would veto a bill if it reaches his desk.

If New York does legalize sports betting, it would join a growing number of states that have taken similar steps in recent years. In 2017, for example, Nevada became the first state in the U.S. to offer legal sports betting, followed by Delaware and Mississippi later that year. West Virginia also began offering legal sports betting this year, and Rhode Island is set to launch its own sports betting operation next month.

The increasing legalization of sports betting across the U.S. is being driven by several factors, including increased competition from overseas markets and changing attitudes among consumers towards gambling. According to a study released earlier this year by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC, annual wagering on sporting events in the U.S. is expected to grow from $4.7 billion in 2017 to $16.7 billion by 2023.

Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see how quickly other states follow New York’s lead in legalizing sports betting. With more than half of all U.S. states now allowing some form of gambling on sporting events, it seems likely that the legalization trend will continue over the next few years.

#  New York State Considering Legalizing Sports Betting 

On Wednesday, New York lawmakers announced they are considering legalizing sports betting in the state.

The proposal would allow bets to be placed at casinos and racetracks, with the revenue being used to fund education and infrastructure projects.

"I think it is an idea whose time has come," said state Assemblyman J. Gary Pretlow, a sponsor of the legislation. "People are doing it anyway, so we might as well regulate it and tax it."

If the measure is passed, New York would join several other states that have legalized sports betting in recent years.

Opponents of the proposal argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other negative consequences. But supporters say that regulating sports betting would help minimize those risks.

What do you think? Should sports betting be legalized in New York?

#  Pros And Cons Of Legalized Sports Betting In New York

Debate over whether legalized sports betting would produce a financial windfall for New York state continues to rage. Proponents argue that the legalization of sports betting in New York would generate significant new revenue for the state, while opponents contend that such a move would be detrimental to society as a whole. This article will explore the pros and cons of legalized sports betting in New York from both a financial and social standpoint.

On the financial side of the equation, there is no question that legalizing sports betting in New York would result in a significant influx of revenue for the state. In fact, according to a study conducted by The Gaming Commission, legalizing sports betting in New York could generate as much as $1.1 billion in new revenue each year. This is because, contrary to what many people believe, not all sports bets are placed on amateur or professional games. In fact, billions of dollars are wagered on college and professional sporting events each year, making it one of the most popular forms of gambling in the world.

If legalized sports betting were to be introduced in New York, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of this money would stay within state borders, as opposed to being gambled away by out-of-state interests. This would result in a substantial increase in tax revenue for the state government, which could be used to fund important infrastructure projects or reduce taxes for residents.

From a social standpoint, there are also compelling arguments for and against legalizing sports betting in New York. On the one hand, some people argue that legalizing sports betting would lead to an increase in problem gambling rates and addiction rates statewide. Furthermore, they contend that it would be difficult to police illegal bookmakers and that widespread legalization would inevitably lead to an increase in organized crime activity.

On the other hand, supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it is no different than any other form of gambling and that regulating it would help mitigate any potential social harms. They also point out that problem gambling rates are already high in New York and legalization would at least provide some means of tracking and monitoring these activities moving forward. Finally, they contend that legalization would bring more business into legitimate establishments like casinos and racetracks, thus creating jobs and economic opportunities throughout the state.

In conclusion, there are pros and cons to legalizing sports betting in New York from both a financial and social standpoint. Ultimately, it is up to lawmakers and citizens alike to decide if this is an issue worth exploring further.

#  New York To Vote On Legalizing Sports Betting

On November 6, New Yorkers will vote on whether to legalize sports betting.

If the measure is approved, casinos and other gaming establishments in the state will be able to offer sports betting. The bill would also allow for mobile betting, which is seen as an important step in expanding sports betting beyond the traditional casino setting.

Supporters of the measure say that it will generate revenue for the state and create jobs. They also argue that it is a more responsible way to bet than through illegal channels.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to gambling addiction and other social problems. They also point out that there is no guarantee that the revenue generated will be used for public purposes.

The outcome of the vote is uncertain, but if it passes, New York would join a growing number of states that have legalized sports betting.
