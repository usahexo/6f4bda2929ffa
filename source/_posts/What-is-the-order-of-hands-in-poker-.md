#  What is a royal flush? 

There are a few variants of poker, but in all of them, the goal is to make the best five-card hand from the seven cards you are dealt. The ace is high and the two is low. There are four suits in poker-clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades. There are thirteen cards of each suit, so there are 4 suits x 13 = 52 cards in a deck. A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of ace, king, queen, jack, and ten of the same suit. It's also called a "natural".

There are different ways to make a royal flush. In community card poker games like Texas Hold'em or Omaha, you can make a royal flush by getting one of your hole cards and two other cards from the table that match your suit. So for example if you have an ace of clubs in your hand and two other clubs on the table, you would have a royal flush. If playing with only one deck (not 52), then there are only 4 different ways to make a royal flush-A♣ K♣ Q♣ J♣ 10♣ (all Clubs), A♦ K♦ Q♦ J♦ 10♦ (all Spades), A♥ K♥ Q♥ J♥ 10♥ (all Hearts), and A♠ K♠ Q♠ J♠ 10♠ (all Diamonds). 

In draw poker variants like Five Card Draw or Triple Draw, you also need at least one pair to make a winning hand. So if you had 5 clubs in your hand including an ace and two other clubs on the table, you would have four clubs left in the deck which isn't enough to make a royal flush. You could still win with this hand if no one else has anything better than three of a kind or better; however it would not be considered a royal flush.

#  How can you improve your hand? 

One of the simplest ways to improve your hand is by practicing regularly. If you want to be a better poker player, then you need to be able to make better decisions with your hand. The more you practice, the better those decisions will become.

Another way to improve your hand is by studying the game. There are plenty of resources available that can help you learn more about the different aspects of poker. This includes learning about hand rankings, as well as learning how to read the other players at the table.

You can also improve your hand by playing in different types of games. In some games, there may be more opportunities for strong hands than others. By playing in a variety of games, you will have a better chance of being dealt a strong hand. You will also learn which games are best suited for your style of play.

Finally, you can also improve your hand by using strategy and tactics. This includes things such as bluffing, slow-playing and value betting. By using these strategies, you will be able to get the most value from your good hands, and minimize losses when you are dealt a weak hand.

#  What beats what in poker? 

There are many different variations of poker, and with so many potential hands to be played, it can be difficult to remember what beats what. This guide provides a basic outline of the winning hands in poker, from royal flush down to one pair.

### The winning hands

A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker, and consists of 10, J, Q, K and A all of the same suit. This hand is unbeatable, and any other combination of cards would be defeated by a royal flush.

Following the royal flush is a straight flush, which is five consecutive cards all of the same suit. This can also include an ace as high or low card. If two players have a straight flush, the player with the highest card wins.

After the straight flush comes four of a kind, which consists of four cards all of the same rank. If two players have four of a kind then the player with the highest ranking four of a kind wins. If both players have the same ranking four of a kind then it goes to the fifth card to determine who wins (known as ‘the kicker’).

Full house is next on the list, and this is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. Again if two players have full houses then the player with the highest ranking three cards wins. If both players have the same ranking three cards then it goes to their two other cards to determine who wins.

After full house comes three of a kind. As you may guess, this hand is made up of three cards all of the same rank. Again if two players have three of a kind then the player with the highest ranking three cards wins. If both players have the same ranking three cards then it goes to their other two cards to determine who wins.

Finally we come to one pair, which as you may expect is made up of two cards all of the same rank. If two players have one pair then whoever has got highest ranked pair will win that particular hand.

#  What is a straight flush?

A straight flush is, as the name suggests, a poker hand that consists of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. The ace can count as either high or low, making a straight flush from 2 through 5, or 6 through 10. A royal flush, an ace-highstraight flush, is the best possible hand in poker and is extremely rare.

The odds of being dealt a straight flush vary depending on the game's variant and the number of decks used, but are usually around 1 in 72,000 when playing with a single deck. With multiple decks, the odds increase to about 1 in 230,000.
