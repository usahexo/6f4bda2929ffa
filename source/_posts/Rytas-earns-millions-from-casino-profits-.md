#  Rytas earns millions from casino profits 

Lithuania's richest man Žygimantas Vaičiūnas has built his fortune on the brick and mortar casino business. His company, Rytas, made a profit of nearly €10 million in 2017, according to financial data released this week. 

But the luck may be running out for the gambling mogul as online casinos take an ever-growing share of the global gaming market. Lithuania is one of the few European Union countries that has yet to legalise online gambling, but that is likely to change this year as lawmakers seek to plug a budget shortfall. 

Rytas currently operates two brick and mortar casinos in Vilnius and Kaunas, but is barred from offering its services online. That could soon change as a new bill expected to be introduced in parliament in March would liberalise the online gaming sector. 

The move would give a boost to Lithuania's GDP, which economists say could grow by as much as 0.5% if the legislation is passed. It would also bring in much-needed revenue for the government, which is facing a budget deficit of close to 3% of GDP this year. 

Vaičiūnas made his fortune in the early 2000s when he acquired a controlling stake in Rytas, then a small regional casino operator. He has since built it into one of the largest gaming companies in Eastern Europe. The group operates casinos, betting shops and online gaming websites in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Romania. 

Rytas posted revenues of €179 million last year, up from €161 million in 2016. The company's net profit rose from €8 million to €9.7 million over the same period.

#  Rytas cashes in on soaring eagle casino partnership 

Lithuanian basketball powerhouse Rytas Vilnius has agreed a partnership with Eagle Casino & Resort that will see the club take up residence at the venue for the next two years.

The move represents a significant coup for the casino, which is Lithuania's only legal gambling establishment, and is seen as a major statement of intent as the company looks to expand its operations into new markets.

For Rytas, the deal provides access to top-quality training facilities and first-class accommodation, while also giving the club a large new fanbase among Eagle Casino's customers.

"Eagle Casino has been looking to build links with one of Europe's leading basketball clubs for some time now," said Eagle Casino CEO Darius Siksnys. "Rytas Vilnius is an excellent partner for us and we're excited to be working with them."

Rytas chairman Gediminas Zilinskas added: "This partnership is a very important step for our club. We are looking forward to working with Eagle Casino & Resort and utilizing their world-class facilities."

The economic impact of the casino has not only been felt by the immediate community, but also by the state as a whole. The casino has created 1,028 jobs and $44.7 million in wages. In addition, it has generated over $11 million in state and local taxes.

In the Lithuanian town of Kaunas, the Rytas basketball club is celebrating a major victory. The team has just completed the purchase of a casino license, giving them a stake in the city's soaring eagle casino expansion.

The move is seen as a major coup for Rytas, which already operates one of the busiest casinos in Lithuania. The expansion project is expected to create around 1,000 jobs in the city and bring in an extra €30 million in annual revenue.

"This is a very exciting day for us," said Rytas president Darius Gudelis. "With this acquisition, we are firmly establishing ourselves as one of the leading players in the Lithuanian casino market."

Rytas is not alone in its excitement. The soaring eagle casino expansion is being seen as a major vote of confidence in Lithuania's economy, which has been enjoying strong growth in recent years. The new facility will offer a range of gaming options, including slots, table games and poker tournaments. There will also be a luxury hotel and restaurant complex on site.

Construction on the project is scheduled to begin later this year and is expected to be completed by 2020.

#  Rytas receives millions in revenue from soaring eagle casino

The Rytas Vilnius basketball club announced a new sponsorship deal with the soaring eagle casino. The agreement is said to be worth millions of euros and will see the casino become the team's main sponsor.

Rytas has had a difficult few years, with financial difficulties and a lack of sponsors. The new agreement is seen as a major boost for the club and its players. Some of the money from the deal will be used to pay off the club's debts.

The soaring eagle casino is one of the largest in Michigan, with over 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games. It is expected that the sponsorship deal will increase tourism to Vilnius, as people come to see how their favorite team is doing.

Rytas has won 3 Lithuanian championships and 1 cup trophy.
