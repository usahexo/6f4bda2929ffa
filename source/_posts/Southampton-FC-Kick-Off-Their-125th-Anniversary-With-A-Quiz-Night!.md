#  Southampton FC's Blackjack Origins Explored In New Book

Southampton Football Club has a long and storied history, with origins that can be traced back to the very beginnings of football as a sport. But what many fans may not know is that the club's blackjack roots are also deeply entrenched in its past.

A new book, entitled "Southampton FC: The Blackjack Club", takes an in-depth look at the club's early days and how blackjack played a central role in its development. The author, Stuart J. Ray, interviewed numerous former players and staff members who shared their memories of those days, and the book provides a unique perspective on the club's history.

According to Ray, Southampton FC was originally formed in 1885 as a social club for dock workers in the town of Southampton. The original name of the club was "The Dutch Schoole", and it was only later that it became known as Southampton FC. One of the main activities of the club was playing football, but it was also involved in other pursuits like card games, including blackjack.

In fact, blackjack was so popular among the members of the club that they eventually formed their own blackjack team which competed against other local teams. And in 1894, Southampton FC even hosted its own blackjack tournament, which was won by a team from Portsmouth.

The book also includes profiles of some of the early players and managers who helped turn Southampton FC into a successful football club. Men like Jimmy McIntyre and Ted Bates were instrumental in developing the team's playing style and helping them to achieve notable victories.

Overall, "Southampton FC: The Blackjack Club" provides an interesting glimpse into the club's hidden past and sheds light on how blackjack played an important role in its early development. It's sure to appeal to all fans of Southampton FC history and football alike.

#  Southampton FC To Celebrate 125 Years With Exhibition Match

The Southampton Football Club, also known as The Saints, will celebrate their 125th anniversary with a celebratory exhibition match against EFL Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers. The game is set to take place on Friday, March 23 at St. Mary's Stadium in Southampton.

The upcoming match is expected to be a highly entertaining event, as both teams are fighting for promotion to the Premier League. Southampton is currently in 8th place in the EFL Championship table, while Wolves sits in 2nd.

Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo is looking forward to the occasion and believes that it will be a valuable experience for his players. "It will be a good game and it's important for our team," said Santo. "To play against Premier League opponents and feel what it is like before we play them next season – it can only be good for us."

Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino also views the game as a valuable opportunity for his players. "It's very important to play these kind of games," said Pellegrino. "We want to improve our squad and playing against teams like Wolves helps us to see where we are."

Both squads are expected to feature a mix of first-team players and youngsters. Southampton has already announced that Fraser Forster, Cedric Soares, Maya Yoshida, Matt Targett, and Sam Gallagher will start, while Wolves have confirmed that they will bring along loanee Harry Wilson from Liverpool.

Tickets for thematch are now available on the Southampton FC website. Prices range from £10-£32, with discounts available for supporters aged 16 or younger.

#  Southampton FC125: How A Club Came To Be

Southampton Football Club has a rich and detailed history, starting from its formation in 1885. It would be impossible to sum up the club's entire past in a single article, but this will give an overview of how Southampton FC125 came to be.

The club was founded on August 10th, 1885 by members of the St. Mary's Church Young Men's Association. The team played its first match against Protestant Boys at Freemantle on November 14th of that year, losing 2-0.

The Saints struggled during their early years, but they did eventually manage to gain promotion to the Southern League in 1898. This led to their first ever appearance in the FA Cup later that year, where they were unfortunately knocked out in the first round by Wolves.

In 1920, Southampton FC was elected to the Football League Second Division. They quickly made their mark on English football, reaching the FA Cup final for the first time in 1926. Unfortunately, they were once again defeated, this time by Manchester City.

The club continued to improve over the next few years, and finally achieved promotion to the top-flight of English football in 1930. They would then go on to make history in 1938 by becoming the first ever English side to win a major trophy outside of England - beating Borussia Dortmund 5-4 in the final of the 1937/38 European Cup Winners' Cup.
